## Vue highlights

The product uses Vue to organise separate pages, forms, lists, and smooth screen changes. Shared information stays in one place so every page shows the same result. Automated checks cover the most important actions.

## Java backend highlights

The Java backend uses Spring Boot. It provides real API endpoints to list, search, and create programme task records. It checks incoming information, returns clear errors, exposes a health check, and includes automated Java tests.

## Architecture and state flow

The browser application calls the Java API on port 8080. The Java service checks the request and keeps the shared product information. After a user creates a record, the API returns the saved result and the browser refreshes the list.

## Accessibility and responsive behaviour

Buttons, forms, and links can be used with a keyboard. Labels explain what each field does, and important information is shown with words, not only colours. The layout also adjusts for tablets and phones.
